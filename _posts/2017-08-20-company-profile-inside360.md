### Pioneer and innovation driver of using the opportunities of virtual reality 
Munich, August 2017.

The inside360 GmbH, based in Munich, founded by Marc Forstmann (CEO VR & 360 degree Productions) and Andreas Will (CEO Marketing & Financials) in October 2016 is currently one of the widest-reaching VR companies. The company is regarded throughout Europe as a pioneer and innovation driver in the field of VR films. “Over 60 million people have already seen our movies online“, says Marc Forstmann. He sees the key to success in differentiation through creativity and technology.

inside360 acquired enormous popularity far beyond Germany’s borders with the horror movie production “Inside the Chamber of Horrors” (April 2016), which gained more than 41 million views on Facebook to date. „And we haven’t invested a single cent more of media spendings for this social media VR case.“ The second part (“The Office”), also started extremely successfully at the beginning of June 2017.

In addition to the successful in-house productions and the licensing business, inside360 has already realized a wide range of VR movies (amongst others for VR cinemas in Berlin and Amsterdam), commercials as well as applications for well-known customers such as Hapag-Lloyd Cruises, Sennheiser, Ricoh, Ralph Lauren, Fortuna Düsseldorf, or the University of Ulm. “Currently we’re moving into very interesting sectors beyond the classical gaming-applications – such as tourism, sports, and automotive as well as the medical sector, where VR technologies can be used for immersive knowledge transfer.”

For the current year, the two CEOs have placed their focus on the fields of advertisements/commercials, app development, and productions of sporting events. In the following year, additional international productions are planned. “We’re growing very successful and we want to make use of the opportunities of the growing VR application market in an optimal way.”

### The virtual reality market is growing worldwide: “The success of VR depends significantly on the appropriate content.”

In 2020, German companies will invest nearly 840 million euros in virtual and mixed reality solutions; innovative B2B applications are going to take care of the lion’s share. This conclusion was reached by a survey of the potentials of VR technology in German businesses conducted by the digital association BITKOM, the consultancy Deloitte and the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology (Source: „Head Mounted Displays in deutschen Unternehmen – Ein Virtual, Augmented und Mixed Reality Check“, status of May 2016). In this context, the experts are even talking of the “Next Big Thing” in consumer electronics. “Virtual reality is definitely not a short-term trend. It is fascinating in which fields the technology can be applied and how it has an effect on the audience”, says Forstmann.

Meanwhile, not only the hardware market (in particular VR goggles) grows – the content is getting more and more diverse as well. “And this is exactly how it should be”, states Forstmann. “Merely technology alone is not enough – the success depends essentially on interesting content with added value for the user.” Film producers, publishers, sporting events and concert organizers have long since become intensely involved with how to connect and market their products and services with VR. According to the consumer electronic association GFU, the fields of future application that will experience a change through virtual reality includes education, business communication, or shopping. “We, too, see enormous potential for businesses as well – from brand positioning to know-how transfer all the way through to a completely new way of active customer acquisition and customer loyalty.”

### Full service and quality, from the conception through to distribution:  “The content is crucial – that the effect works, is a premise”
    
The highest demands on content and technology: This holds true for the team of inside360 who implement everything from the conception to distribution of VR movies and applications under one roof – like hardly any other provider. “Through an uninterrupted internal workflow it is possible for us to offer not only significantly shorter production periods but rather guarantee for our own high quality standards from beginning to end.” Another aspect is the development of individual camera systems as well as particular perspectives. “Our constant innovative advancement is clearly process driven.”

In addition to conception, storyboard & storytelling, the operational workload for the preparation of a 360 degree movie is divided into the areas production and filming as well as the post production, editing and special effects. Target setting and content design are of special importance for inside360: „It is not difficult to set up a VR camera“, says Forstmann. But he is much more interested in figuring out the best way for the client to effectively use the VR technology in order to reach certain goals. „We are producing solution-oriented and create genuine added value for our clients.“

The VR content that is conceptualized and produced in that way can be applied in very different areas by businesses and organizations: to engage in innovative recruiting, to optimize the customer acquisition, to draw up an effective online marketing, to increase sales at the POS, or to sustainably support the market in order to improve sales rates.

The currently ten-strong project and production team is to be expanded by additional VR experts in the following months. Forstmann does not anticipate any difficulties in recruiting them: “We cultivate close contacts to universities and, due to the topic VR, we are an extremely attractive employer for graduates.”
