### Marc Forstmann: „I invested the best euro of my life in a pair of VR goggles at a street stall” 
Munich, August 2017.

Marc Forstmann is co-founder and CEO of inside360 GmbH, one of the widest-reaching companies in the field of virtual reality worldwide. Together with his team, he produces VR cinema films, commercials and applications for businesses and organizations around the globe. Furthermore, the native Westphalian consults and supports well-known brand companies in identifying and using the opportunities of virtual reality as early as possible. He shares his experiences as a guest lecturer at several universities and via public speeches. “I want to help others find their own way in terms of digitalization and the digital transformation.”

After he produced his first short film at the age of fourteen – and thereby discovering his passion for turning ideas into reality –, Marc Forstmann founded his first company at the age of fifteen. “I wanted to have the opportunity to realize even greater ideas and projects.” The moment he tried some VR goggles at a street stall in Istanbul, he saw for the first time the future potential of this technology. Subsequently, he established his first virtual reality start up. The success was not long in coming: Soon Forstmann was working together with notable customers such as Hapag Lloyd or Ralph Lauren.

The determination to push the field of virtual reality further and to be amongst the best, drove Forstmann to found the Munich based inside GmbH, together with Andreas Will, in October 2016. So far, he and his team have managed to fascinate more than 60 million people with VR films and applications.
